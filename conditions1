#steps
1 import the  data
2 clean the data
3 split the data into training/ test sets
   for example :
   if you have 1000 pics of cats and dogs ;
   we can reserve 80% for training ;
   and another 20% for testing
4 create a model
5 train the model
6 make predictions
7 evaluate and improve
=================================
Libraries and tools :
1 Numpy : provides a multidimensional array and very popular
2 pandas : is a data analysis library that provides a concept data frame. Data frame is a two dimensional data structure
           similar to an excel spreadsheet.so we have rows and columns.
3 MatPlotLib : is a two dimensional plotting library for creating graphs on plots.
4 Scikit-Learn : we use it machine learning neural networks and common algorithm like decision trees.
  now , we use the jupyter...
